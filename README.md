# Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick in Racket

## About

These are implementations of the algorithms defined the first edition of [Algorithms in C++](https://amzn.to/2I8MtlS) by [Robert Sedgewick](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) but in [racket](https://racket-lang.org/).

While the [current version of Sedgewick's Algorithms](https://amzn.to/2IhQbtE) is implemented in [java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), this is my attempt to use a [lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) style language instead.

## Algorithms

* [Euclid's algorithm](chapter-2/gcd.rkt) for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers
