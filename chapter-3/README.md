# Elementary Data Structures

## Arrays

These are continguous blocks of memory, whose key feature is constant time lookup.

[Vectors](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/vectors.html?q=vector#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._vector%29%29) are how they are implemented in [racket/base](https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/index.html)

## Linked Lists 

Linked lists are disparate chunks of memory, joined by pointers in memory. They come in primarily two flavors, [singly-linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Singly_linked_list) and [doubly-linked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list).

As Sedgewick notes, these are native to lisp, and [racket lists](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/pairs.html) are implemented as singly-linked lists.
